Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. I would like to use this opportunity to review what I have learnt during this internship and discuss the progress of the data recap project. It's been an incredibly enlightening journey. I am very lucky to rotate through different desks.  These rotations allowed me to gain a broad perspective on the operations within the Treasury Department.

I feel that ATD functions almost like a bank within the bank. We take care of funding, fund transfer pricing adn we also need to deal with regulatory changes. This internship gave me an opportunity to witness how financial insitution takes actions in a constantly moving market  

The timing of this internship has been particularly interesting because the market has been highly dynamic, with significant movements that I was able to observe firsthand. This exposure allowed me to witness how market events transition from mere news headlines to actual operational impacts within financial institutions. In the past, when asked about something like a rate cut, I could offer general commentary on economic conditions or discuss forward guidance. However, I never really felt the weight of these decisions. That changed about two weeks ago when the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) numbers came in lower than expected. Our response was to stop posting fixed rates, and at that moment, it struck me—"This is the real deal!" It was a powerful experience that fundamentally changed my perspective on the market.

A key takeaway from this internship has been the importance of independent thinking, especially when it comes to understanding the market. Nagai-san, one of my mentors, emphasized this by teaching me a critical lesson: when something happens in the market, it's essential to dig deep, form my own opinions, and not simply echo what the media reports. He would often challenge me with questions like, “How do you think the market will react to Harris taking office?” “When do you expect the next rate cut?” and “What direction do you think USD/JPY is heading?” These questions weren’t just about assessing my current knowledge or gauging how much I had learned; they were deliberately crafted to push me beyond surface-level understanding.

What is the projection for JPY.

By engaging with these complex, multi-faceted questions, I was encouraged to move beyond a passive absorption of information and develop a more nuanced, independent perspective. This process not only sharpened my analytical skills but also helped me build confidence in my ability to navigate the complexities of financial markets on my own.

Now, I'd like to talk about the project I worked on during this internship. I was involved in the recap project because we needed a tool that could help clean up, organize, and add more information to the data we collect about Certificates of Deposit (CD) and Commercial Paper (CP) deals. There were a few challenges with this project. First, the data we received came in different formats, which made it hard to process consistently. Also, the raw data often didn't include important details about the issuers, which we needed for a complete analysis. Sometimes, we even had to do extra work to make the data usable.

To tackle these challenges, I decided to use regular expressions, which are a way to search and extract specific information from the data. This allowed us to pull out the key details and put them into a database using Excel macros. Once the data was organized, I used a tool called Power Pivot to link different tables in the database together. This helped us create visualizations and better understand the data. For example, I connected a “Country” table with the main database using a common “ticker” column, which added information about the country of origin for each issuer.

While the project was successful, there are still some areas for improvement. First, the code I wrote works well most of the time, but it might not handle new data patterns. We also need to be careful about duplicate data entries because some issuances are reported more than once, which could lead to counting the same data twice. Finally, we could make the data even better by adding more details, like the credit profiles of issuers or other information from their financial statements.
